## Project brief

A blogging platform that meets the following minimum criteria:
#### The app must:

* Have at least 2 models â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app.

* Incude relationships - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.

* The app should include authentication - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.

* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.

* Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.

* Have semantically clean HTML - write HTML that makes structural sense.

* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

### Challenges
As this was my first ever full stack project and we had covered user registration, password hashing, password salting, JSON token and user authentication, I simply was not able to implement these into my project.
### Wins
The wins for this project were that I was successfully created a RESTful EJS full stack web app and I worked on a project which was in tune with my personally interests.

### Favourite feature

I enjoyed going through my many code challenges throughout the project. My favourite piece of code is how the quotes index is generated. The quotes is an array  embedded under each movie model i.e. multiple quotes per movie. So in order to display an index of all the quotes embedded under all the movies we iterate over movies and per movie use .reduce and .concat methods to send the collection of quotes to the index page.  
```js
function quotesIndex(req, res) {
  Movie
    .find() // All the movies!
    .then(movies =>  {
      const quotes =  movies.reduce((arr, movie) => {
        return arr.concat(movie.quotes);
      },[]);

      res.render('quotes/index', {quotes});
    })
    .catch(err => console.log('Error collecting quotes', err));
}
```

## Future features
There are plenty of features which given the time I would love to add to this game such as
* Complete the mailing list Db model
* Complete user authentication
* Add carrousel on landing page of latest quotations
* Better user flow
* Better wireframes
